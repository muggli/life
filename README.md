# life

This project was done while I was living in Japan around 2016, with minor maintenance between then and now.  Finally moving it into github in 2022.  

This was created by pulling different templates and examples from the internet, and ended up being a not very clean finished product.  That said, it fulfilled my needs at the time of allowing an easy way to share our wedding experiences with family and friends in both Japan and the USA.

If I had the time and energy I'd completely rewrite this from the ground up.  However, it served it's purpose and I'd rather focus my energy elsewhere so it'll remain as is for the indefinite future.
